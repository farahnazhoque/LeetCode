# LeetCocde Era
 
## My journey with LeetCode:
For the longest time, I have been quite intimidated by LeetCode problems, and frankly, it was due to the fact that it did not come naturally to me as most coding projects and school problems have. Sitting with the truth that I would go on for a whole hour without solving a single problem was extremely uncomfortable. However, I always had a tendency to never give up too, and always revisiting problems or issues I could never move past. So, I have decided to take this challenge up and learn to do LeetCode more as a puzzle than as something my whole future career depends on.

## My motivation:
I recently learnt that I get to define what failure looks like. Previously, I would often feel it was a failure on my part if I only managed to solve one problem in a day. Now, I understand that the active effort of showing up and deeply understanding that one problem is far more valuable than skimming through solutions to complete three problems in an hourâ€”or worse, avoiding the challenge altogether due to fear. Embracing the process of learning something new and exercising my problem-solving skills is now my primary motivation. This shift in perspective not only fosters my growth but also builds resilience
